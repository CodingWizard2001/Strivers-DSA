## Description: The provided C++ program generates a rectangular pattern of asterisks based on user input for the number of rows and columns. 

### Explanation

- **User Input:** The program prompts the user to enter the number of rows and columns for the pattern.

- **Nested Loops:** The program uses nested loops to iterate through each row and column.

- **Printing Asterisks:** The inner loop (j) prints an asterisk (*) followed by a space for each column.

- **Newline for Rows:** After printing all the asterisks in a row, the outer loop (i) adds a newline to move to the next row.

- **Repetition:** The nested loops repeat until the specified number of rows and columns are reached, creating the desired rectangular pattern.

- **Output:** The final output is a rectangular pattern of asterisks based on user-specified dimensions.

### Example
For example, if the user inputs 5 for both rows and columns, the program will generate the following pattern:
<br/>
<br/>
<p align = "center">
* * * * *
<br/>
* * * * *
<br/>
* * * * *
<br/>
* * * * *
<br/>
* * * * *
</p>
