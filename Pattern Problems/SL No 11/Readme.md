## Description: The provided C++ program generates a triangular pattern of numbers based on user input for the numbers of rows and columns. 

### Explanation

- Take input for the number of rows (rows).
- Use a loop to iterate over each row (i).
- Inside the loop, use nested loops to iterate over each position within the row (j).
- Use conditional statements to determine whether to print '1' or '0' based on the row number and position.
- Print each digit ('1' or '0') accordingly.
- Print a newline after printing all digits in a row.

### Example
For example, if the user inputs 5 for both rows the program will generate the following pattern:
<br/>
<br/>
```cpp

1
01
101
0101
10101

```
