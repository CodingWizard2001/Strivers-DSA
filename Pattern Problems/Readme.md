# Striver's DSA Sheet - Pattern Problems
This repository contains solutions to the pattern problems from Striver's DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) sheet. These problems are commonly encountered in coding interviews and are essential for building a strong foundation in algorithmic problem-solving.

### What is Striver's DSA Sheet?
Striver's DSA Sheet is a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms problems curated by Striver (Nikhil Kumar). It covers a wide range of topics including arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more.

### Pattern Problems
Pattern problems are a subset of problems focusing on recognizing and generating patterns. These problems are essential for improving logical reasoning and algorithmic thinking skills. Solutions to pattern problems often involve a combination of mathematical analysis and programming techniques.
