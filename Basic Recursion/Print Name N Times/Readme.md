# Print Name N Times


### Description
The provided code prints a given name multiple times as specified by the user.

### Steps to Solve the Problem
- **Input:** Prompt the user to enter a number.
- **Read Input:** Read the input number from the user.
- **Recursive Function:** Implement a recursive function `print(int i, int num)` to print the name multiple times. In each recursive call, print the name once and increment the counter `(i)`. Continue this process until the counter reaches the specified number of times `(num)`.
- **Output:** Print the name num times.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the input number.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(N) due to the recursive function calls.
